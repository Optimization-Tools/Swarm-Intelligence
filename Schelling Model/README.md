# Demonstration of Homophily by Schellingâ€™s Segregation Model:

## Theory and Importance:

In swarm intelligence, one part of the study is to understand how people in society behave in a specific
way. One such concept of homophily is represented here. Homophily is the tendency of individuals to
bond and connect with similar other people. A good example of this is the formation of geographical
areas with similar race of people.

## Method Used:

The world is assumed to be populated by 800 agents of two subclasses. There will be 8 neighbours to
each agent. An agent is said to be unsatisfied if he is not surrounded by at least 3 people of his own
kind. In other words, three-eighth of his neighbours should be of his kind, which seems pretty much
reasonable. But even in this case we can see that clustering happens. This model explains why it is very
hard to break homophily and clustering of people.

## Sofwares Used:

* The model is implemented in python 3.5.2
* The version of numpy package is 1.14.0
* The version of matplotlib package is 2.1.2
